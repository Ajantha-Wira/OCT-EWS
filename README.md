## Overview

This repository presents the Early Warning System (EWS), a post-classification safety framework for detecting structurally atypical normal predictions in deep learning-based OCT screening.
This work forms the foundational framework for subsequent research on representation-space safety and distance-based modelling in medical AI.

The work is introduced in:

> *An Embedding-Based Post-Classification Safety Layer for Detecting Unsafe Normal Predictions in OCT Screening*  
> [Zenodo DOI – to be updated]

Unlike conventional uncertainty methods that rely on softmax confidence, the EWS operates in representation space, analysing embedding geometry to identify predictions that may be unsafe to accept automatically.

## Framework

The system consists of three sequential layers:

- **Layer A** — Mahalanobis distance-based atypicality detection
- **Layer B** — Disease-direction geometry analysis
- **Layer C** — Clinical prioritisation and workflow decisions

## Repository Structure

This public repository provides a conceptual and structural overview of the system architecture.

The full implementation includes modules for:
- data management and preprocessing
- reference distribution construction
- anomaly scoring (Mahalanobis distance)
- disease-direction analysis
- reporting and monitoring

The complete source code is maintained in a private repository and will be released in a future version.
