# OCT Early Warning System (OCT-EWS)
A representation-space early warning system for detecting unsafe normal 
predictions in automated OCT screening using embedding-space geometry. 
This work forms the foundational framework for subsequent research on 
representation-space safety and distance-based modelling in medical AI.

## Overview
This repository presents the Early Warning System (EWS), a 
post-classification safety framework for detecting structurally atypical 
normal predictions in deep learning-based OCT screening. This work forms 
the foundational framework for subsequent research on representation-space 
safety and distance-based modelling in medical AI.

Unlike conventional uncertainty methods that rely on softmax confidence, 
the EWS operates in representation space, analysing embedding geometry to 
identify predictions that may be unsafe to accept automatically.

## Framework
The system consists of three sequential layers:
- **Layer A** — Mahalanobis distance-based atypicality detection
- **Layer B** — Disease-direction geometry analysis
- **Layer C** — Clinical prioritisation and workflow decisions

## Repository Structure
This public repository provides a conceptual and structural overview of 
the system architecture.

The full implementation includes modules for:
- data management and preprocessing
- reference distribution construction
- anomaly scoring (Mahalanobis distance)
- disease-direction analysis
- reporting and monitoring

The structure below outlines the full system architecture, including 
modules currently maintained in a private repository.
